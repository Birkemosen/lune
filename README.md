# Lune V6

ESPHome firmware for **Lune V6**, the Guldborg & Birkemose 6-zone hydronic
underfloor-heating manifold controller, built on ESP32-S3 with 6 DRV8215 I2C
motor drivers.

The repository and firmware internals still use the historical `heatvalve-6`
and `hv6` names while the public product structure migrates to Lune. Avoid
large renames unless they are part of a planned migration.

Lune V6 is the local manifold node in the Lune product line. It owns valve
motion, endstop detection, local temperature inputs, minimum-flow protection,
motor fault handling, and conservative fail-safe heating. Whole-house learning
and optimization belongs in the future Lune Touch / Lune Mini coordinator.

This repository is ESPHome-only. The legacy PlatformIO and ESP-IDF source tree
has been removed.

## What Is In The Firmware

- ESPHome on ESP-IDF
- 6-zone valve control with DRV8215 over I2C
- Custom C++ external components for config storage, valve control, and zone control
- Native ESPHome WiFi, API, OTA, web server, display, and climate entities
- DS18B20 1-Wire temperature sensors
- SSD1306 OLED support
- WS2812 status LED

## Hardware Mapping

| GPIO | Function |
|------|----------|
| GPIO1 | Motor current sense ADC |
| GPIO2 | DRV8215 nSLEEP |
| GPIO7 | DRV8215 nFAULT |
| GPIO8 | I2C SDA |
| GPIO9 | I2C SCL |
| GPIO12 | 1-Wire bus |
| GPIO48 | WS2812 status LED |

### DRV8215 Addresses

| Zone | Address |
|------|---------|
| 1 | 0x30 |
| 2 | 0x31 |
| 3 | 0x32 |
| 4 | 0x35 |
| 5 | 0x33 |
| 6 | 0x34 |

Only one motor should run at a time because current sensing is shared.

## Quick Start

1. Edit `secrets.yaml` with your WiFi, API, OTA, and optional MQTT values.
2. Replace the placeholder DS18B20 addresses in `heatvalve-6.yaml` after first discovery.
3. Build or deploy from the repo root.

Preferred workflow:

```bash
make build
make deploy
make logs
```

If you want USB flashing explicitly:

```bash
make deploy PORT=/dev/cu.usbmodemXXXX
```

If you want OTA to a specific host/IP:

```bash
make ota HOST=192.168.1.50
```

The `Makefile` automatically uses `.venv/bin/esphome` when present.

Direct ESPHome commands still work:

```bash
esphome run heatvalve-6.yaml
```

For config validation only:

```bash
esphome config heatvalve-6.yaml
```

## Notes

- The current firmware layout assumes the ESPHome config lives at the repository root.
- `secrets.yaml` is kept as a local template and remains gitignored.
- The repository has not been fully compile-tested yet after the migration.
