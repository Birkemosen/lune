# Changelog

## v2.0.0 — ESP-IDF Rewrite (2025-07-09)

Complete rewrite from ESPHome YAML to pure ESP-IDF C++ with PlatformIO.

### Breaking Changes
- All ESPHome YAML configuration removed — firmware is now native C++
- Build system changed from ESPHome to PlatformIO (`make build` / `make flash`)
- Configuration via NVS + web dashboard instead of YAML substitutions

### Hardware (v2 PCB)
- Switched from legacy H-bridge + MUX to **6× DRV8215 I2C motor drivers**
- Removed INA219 + LMV358 tacho stage — current sensing via shared IPROPI (GPIO1)
- Added shared nSLEEP (GPIO2) and wired-OR nFAULT (GPIO7)
- Motor addresses: 0x30–0x35 via A1/A0 pin strapping

### Firmware
- **Pure ESP-IDF v5.x** with FreeRTOS tasks (no Arduino, no ESPHome runtime)
- 8 modular libraries: config_store, wifi_manager, valve_controller, sensor_manager, zone_controller, mqtt_handler, web_dashboard, ota_updater
- System manager with task watchdog (5s heartbeat) and coordinated startup
- Dual-core task layout: valve control on Core 1 (10ms), zone/sensor/mqtt on Core 0

### Control
- 4 algorithms retained: Tanh, Linear, PID, Adaptive (runtime-switchable)
- Hydraulic balancing with pipe length, spacing, and floor cover correction
- Failsafe: temperature timeout (5min → maintenance position), MQTT timeout (30min → clear offsets)
- Minimum flow enforcement (10% valve opening)

### Connectivity
- MQTT with Home Assistant auto-discovery (climate + sensor entities)
- Compatible with helios-6 Go service for multi-controller optimization
- Built-in web dashboard (responsive SPA, no external dependencies)
- OTA via HTTP POST to `/api/ota` with dual-partition rollback

### Documentation
- Rewrote ARCHITECTURE.md for ESP-IDF task model and data flow
- Rewrote README.md with PlatformIO build instructions and REST API reference

## v1.0.1 — Power & Docs Update (2026-02-13)

### Hardware
- ESP32 powered via 5V pin (VBUS) through SS14 Schottky diode for backfeed protection
- AMS1117 (3V3_LOG) now powers analog/peripherals only, not ESP32
- Added D_5V (SS14, 1A/40V, SMA) to BOM

### Documentation
- Updated power architecture: three independent paths (ESP32, 3V3_MOT, 3V3_LOG)
- Updated README GPIO table to match current design

## v1.0.0 — Initial Release (2026-02-13)

Complete redesign of HeatValve-6 floor heating valve controller.

### Hardware
- ESP32-S3 Super Mini with legacy H-bridge motor driver stage
- 6 valve channels via GAQY212GSX optocoupler multiplexing (odd/even)
- MUX inverter: SN74LVC1G04DBVR (U10)
- INA219 high-side current sense (I2C, 0x40, 100mΩ shunt on MCOM)
- LMV358 dual op-amp tacho conditioning (non-inverting amplifier + Schmitt trigger)
- Tuning pads (R12_ALT, R_REF2_ALT) for prototype tacho calibration
- MT2492 3.3V step-down (3V3_MOT), AMS1117-3.3V LDO (3V3_LOG)
- USB-C power input with 220µF bulk capacitor
- Dallas 1-Wire temperature sensors (8 probes)
- WS2812 status LED with color-coded states
- RJ11/RJ10 connectors, HmIP-VDMOT compatible (pin 1 + pin 3)
