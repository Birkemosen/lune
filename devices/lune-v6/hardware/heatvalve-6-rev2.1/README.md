# HeatValve-6 Rev 2.1 hardware

Editable KiCad 10 design for the USB-C-powered, six-channel DRV8837 HeatValve controller.

## Design state

- Schematic: complete first electrical-review revision; KiCad ERC reports 0 errors.
- PCB: compact four-layer 120 x 75 mm placement review with 128 electrical
  footprints, two M3 holes, an antenna notch, GND/+3V3 inner planes, and an
  intentionally unrouted ratsnest.
- Fabrication status: **not released**. Routing, mechanical confirmation, and final
  footprint/availability review are still required.
- PCB DRC: not current; KiCad CLI 10.0.3 aborts on both the original and updated
  board. See `drc.rpt` and rerun DRC in PCB Editor after routing.
- Prototype tuning: BEMF filter/gain/blanking, force threshold, engagement signature,
  and optional parallel shunt.

## Generate and validate

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/private/tmp/kicad_pydeps HOME=/private/tmp \
  python3 devices/lune-v6/hardware/heatvalve-6-rev2.1/generate_kicad.py

kicad-cli sch erc \
  --output devices/lune-v6/hardware/heatvalve-6-rev2.1/erc.rpt \

```

The committed `.kicad_sch` is usable without the Python generator dependency.

## Important design decisions

- Motors and logic operate from the MT2492-generated 3.3 V rail.
- Only one motor may run at a time.
- All DRV8837 ground returns meet at `SHUNT`; `RSH1` is the only normal return to system ground.
- `RSH1` is 1.0 ohm and INA180A1 provides x20 gain: 30 mA = 0.60 V,
  60 mA = 1.20 V, and 150 mA = 3.00 V. This preserves the pin-engagement peak.
- `R14`, `C13`, and `D5` provide additional ADC filtering and rail clamp protection.
- The hardware force-limit comparator reads the raw Kelvin shunt and remains effective if the ADC path saturates.
- Two 74HC4051 selectors connect only the active motor's A/B terminals to a
  shared differential BEMF front end. `ADC_BEMF` retains the raw waveform and
  `TACHO_EDGE` feeds PCNT after AC gain and hysteresis.
- Shunt ripple is not used as authoritative motion evidence. Firmware must qualify
  tacho edges against BEMF waveform, direction, switching blanking, and cadence.
- The latch powers up with `DRIVE_PERMIT` low and must be explicitly armed by firmware.
- Three OneWire connectors share GPIO42. The DNP I2C header uses GPIO1/GPIO2.
- Motor jacks use the center pair: pin 2 `MOT_A`, pin 3 `MOT_B`.
